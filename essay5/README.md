## prompt

Final Exam:  EWRT 1 A, De Anza College

Instructions: Choose one of the following topics below. You will have a total of three hours to complete your exam. Make certain that in addition to completing the prompt below, you also have included all of the elements of the “must-have” list below. Your grade will be based on your skills in the areas on the “must-have” list, which is the accumulation of all that you have learned this quarter.

### Must Have List

- An effective introduction using one of the five strategies for an opening: narrative, question, definition, quotation, unexpected statement
- An effective thesis statement that responds to the prompt: an effective thesis is a restatement of the topic PLUS a comment on the topic! You must give your “take” on the topic in your thesis, one that will steer your essay.
- A minimum of five body paragraphs: introduction, three body and a conclusion.
- A conclusion with a summary statement that sums up the essay and reinforces the thesis, as well as your concluding remarks.
- Each paragraph must have a topic sentence that states the main idea of each paragraph. The other sentences in the paragraph support the topic sentence.
- Your essay needs transitional words and phrases to take the reader from paragraph to paragraph and idea to idea.
- You will need textual evidence from the story in each body paragraph. You need to use correctly formatted quote sandwiches.
- Each paragraph must have a mix of sentence openings, sentence lengths, and sentence types. Do not write monotonous paragraphs of identical sentence types! Remember to use both compound and complex sentences!
- Grammar and punctuation should be as flawless as possible.
- Correct MLA formatting

### TOPICS (CHOOSE ONLY ONE):

- How does Joyce Carol Oates foreshadow the events that befall Connie? In your essay, consider the ways the author uses foreshadowing to let the reader know that something will go awry. In your response, be careful to discuss the impact this has on you as a reader.
- In “The Things They Carried” Tim O’Brien discusses the hardships of war in a unique way: by focusing on the things each individual carries. In your essay, discuss why this technique is effective, and give examples of how it makes the story work. How is O’Brien able to say more about war with this technique than if he had not used it?
- In “Lust” the author, Susan Minot, seems to construct a list. How and why is this list effective for the meaning of her story? This is a rare technique for an author to use. Give examples of how it is effective, and how in influences the overall impact of her story.
- In “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” the author F. Scott Fitzgerald creates a situation that could never happen in real life. You could almost call it fantasy or science fiction. Discuss why an author would use an event or series of events that are contrary to fact. What impact does it have on your experience as a reader?

<center><h3>A packing list not for our people!</h3></center>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;Was the fight against the spread of communism really worth it? The USA's involvement in the Vietnam war seems inhuman from the perspective of Tim O'Brien's short story "The Things They Carried". O'Brien's writing sends a clear anti-war message by exposing the horrible strain it was putting upon young American men. To do this, he focuses on each burden, physical and emotional, that each soldier carries. This method, while unusual, is startlingly effective because of it's relatability, simplicity, and casual unreality through narrative flow.
</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;"Rat Kiley carried comic books" (O'Brien 219). The characterization created by sharing burdens large and small, physical and emotional allow readers to connect with each character on a more personal level. Rat Kiley is not machine, but rather a young man. Kiowa is no cold hearted killer. He is a "devout Baptist" who carried around a bible with him at all times (O'Brien 219-220). Ted Lavender who died "exceptional burden", carried not only excess combat materials, but also "unweighed fear" (O'Brien 222). Fear is one of the most human feelings to have. In that circumstance, it is not difficult to imagine how scared one might feel. Even though these physical items allow readers to connect and relate with the soldiers on a more basic level, O'Brien exposes deeper outlets of connection using the symbolism of carrying emotional weight.
</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;Just like the characters in the story we can all relate to carrying emotional burdens of our own. Past regrets of missed opportunities, present tragedy, or anxiety about future events to occur are all widespread and common human feelings. While the symbolism O'Brien uses is simple, it's effectiveness cannot be understated. O'Brien makes no attempt to obscure meaning. In this regard, he even explicitly points it out:
</p>

<blockquote>
To carry something was to hump it... In its intransitive form, to hump meant to walk, or to march, but it implied burdens far beyond the intransitive. (O'Brien 220)
</blockquote>

<p>
O'Brien wanted the story to be accessable, even for those with developing analytical skills. To him, the meaning behind the symbolism was more important than the symbolism itself. Cross' daydreaming and obsession over Martha is just one such example. His unrequited love serves as a burden that he carries around with him everywhere he goes. Even when Cross burns the letters from Martha to try relieve himself of the weight, he "realized it was only a gesture" (O'Brien 235) and that the burden he carried was no physical weight.
</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;O'Brien's interleaving of a casual packing list and intimate plot events is a clever usage of the list's narrative flow. By anchoring the story to the central theme of items a soldier might carry, O'Brien is able to deviate into sub plots while establishing a cohesive flow by means of continuing the list once the tangent is at maturity.
</p>

<blockquote>
Afterward they burned Than Khe. They marched until dusk, then dug their holes, and that night Kiowa kept explaining how you had to be there, how fast it was, how the poor guy just dropped like so much concrete. Boom-down, he said. Like cement. In addition to the three standard weapons—the M-60, M-16, and M-79—they carried whatever presented itself, or whatever seemed appropriate as a means of killing or staying alive. (O'Brien 222-223)
</blockquote>

<p>
The brutality of burning Than Khe is deliberately abrupt to catch readers off guard. O'Brien does not dwell on it, however, and provides no further details. Marching on with the story nearly normalizes such an event, creating an absence of effect for readers. The soldiers in the story were caught up in this miasma of unreality as well. Ted Lavender's death shocks the entire platoon: "The guy's dead, he kept saying, which seemed profound—the guy's dead. I mean really." (O'Brien 227). The war and the brutalities were not an illusion, however. Young American men really did go to Vietnam to die for an unjust and unpopular war.
</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;O'Brien's experience in Vietnam wiped away any illusion of a "useful" war. During a period of fierce debate about the legitimacy of the Vietnam war, O'Brien's goal was to persuade readers that there truly was no sense in forcing young American men to die in situations so harsh, they are mistakable for a fever dream. O'Brien's unique usage of conveying events using a nearly packing list-like formula allows a wide swath of readers to empathize with soldiers on a more personal level by understanding their circumstance and humanity.
