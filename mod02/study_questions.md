*The Gangster We Are All Looking For* Pages 3-35

1. Identify the characters in the narrative: list them by name (if they have one) and cite one or two facts about them

- Uncle 1
- Uncle 2
- Uncle 3
- Uncle 4

The narrator and Ba met the four uncles at sea, likely on the fishing boat they
used to flee Vietnam.

- Ma (mother)
- Ba (father)
- Brother
- Narrator (little girl)

We don't actually really know much about these people.
They were likely a complete family before Ba and the narrator fled Vietnam.
Is Ma alive? Is the brother alive?

- Mr. Russell

The one with the dream about the hand dipping into the sea that caused the birds
to fly towards him. That dream was about him helping out some of the people that
were maybe disenfranchised by the war going on over there. He was also in some
branch of the military. Navy, I think?

- Mrs. Russell



- Melvin

One of the more interesting characters. He's very reluctant to host the family
but does anyways to respect his late father's last dream.


2. Identify the places in the narrative: list them by name and cite one or two facts about them.

3. Are there any signs that the narrative is written from the perspective of a small child? Why? How? Give an example.

At the most basic level, the constant daydreaming would indicate that it is from a child's perspective.
However, I think the impeccable attention to detail of objects rather than people shows more.

> I would pair the shoes and leave them in the middle of the room, with their toes pointing towards the door.

If it was from the perspective of an adult, perhaps this would've been written.

> I left the shoes in the middle of the room.

4. Describe the relationships that are developed. How do the characters interact with each other?

5. Give an example of people not saying what they mean.

6. Give an example of a miscommunication based on cultural difference.

7. Give an example of the importance of learning English in this narrative.

Learning English or any native language of a location is integrating with the local culture in it's purest form: communication.

8. Find an excerpt—a paragraph or shorter—that you think is particularly interesting.

> I imagined how all the children standing with their feet pressed firmly against the ground and their heads pointing toward the top of the chain-link fence, would slowly slip into the pale blue sky. I imagined the children floating, their dresses ballooning out around them as the wind ruffled their hair across their faces. I'd look over at Ba, also upside down, and I would imagine him floating too, with his hands folded across his chest.

9. What do you think the metaphorical significance is of the trapped butterfly and glass animals? Explain.

10. What do you know about the mother figure?

11. Americans houses are full of stuff: “Shelves bowing under the weight of book and files lined the walls, and in the center of the room was a large square desk, its top covered with pens papers, receipt books, a tray of keys and spare change” (22).  What is the narrator’s relationship to these things? Why is it so carefully described?

I don't think the narrator has any particular relationship to the items she describes. I think it's to give the point of view that
