In the following segments, the narrator describes people on avian terms:

"He looked small. I thought of the bones of birds" (124).

"Like a dark, wiry bird he seems to be hopping and then gliding across the hot sand." (127)

"His shoulder blades fold--one into the other--like a pair of rented wings" (121)

Reflect on the meaning of these metaphors, and most importantly, what brings them together? What binds the images to each other? (100-200 words)

## response

There was a whole lot of bird and flying imagery in the first few chapters of the novel. It was all mostly positive sounding in nature. In this section, Le corrupts the imagery a little to describe solemn expressions playing across people's bodies.

The first quote about "the bones of birds" is used to describe Ba on the night before Ma's arrival. Presumably, Ba had been reflecting about all of the time they had spent apart and his uncertain journey into the unknown with the narrator. "Bones" is an odd choice since it's more associated with death. Was Ba feeling exhausted inside after all that waiting?

The "dark, wiry bird" is how the narrator describes her grandfather when he held the narrator's dead brother in his arms. The grandfather is not flying like a free bird but rather "hopping". Even though they were the birds that were so reveled in the first few chapters, the birds described here seem to be more of the tired and near death type of bird. Not one that is free to soar in the skies.


I don't want to go over the word limit. Maybe we can talk more about it in class?
