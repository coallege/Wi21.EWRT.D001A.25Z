## response lol

To deal with the trauma and shock of losing her brother to the ocean, the narrator of Le's novel slips into a dreamlike state to escape: "the hole became a room and the room was in a house, ... except that it was underwater" (146). The narrator, in denial of her brother's death, imagines the experience of being under the waves, just like her brother was before he died. Perhaps if it was as peaceful as the "house exactly like the one [she] was laying in" (146), the narrator's brother was fine.
