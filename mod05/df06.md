Write a minimum 200 word statement that indicates your evaluation of book, _The Gangster We Are All Looking For_. This could be the first start of Essay #2, or it could be a portion of one of your body paragraphs, part of your brainstorming, or a new idea you are exploring. To clarify: an evaluation is a reasonable opinion, similar in tone to a movie or book review.

In your three 50 word responses, try to anticipate a counterargument for whatever your peer has said. Try to think about another perspective and give them your insights.
