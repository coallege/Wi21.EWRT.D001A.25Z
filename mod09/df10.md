Consider the viewpoints on war in "The Things They Carried."  O'Brien describes a war in which there was little leadership and much aimlessness. His focus is the equipment the men carried, and how that equipment reflected both their experiences at war and their former experiences at home. How does the protagonist change during the story? How does his relationship to his "things" change in the story? Why? What does this story tell us about the Vietnam War from the American perspective? How is your understanding of this story impacted by learning about the war The Gangster We Are All Looking For and Daughter from Danang?
