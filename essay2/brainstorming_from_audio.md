# complaints about the book

Alright so my review is going to be mostly complaining about the book because
I'm good at complaining.

- Hard to connect with narrator
	- Not relatable?
	- She seems nearly emotionless at times

- Not in chronological order

- Spends way too much time describing things that don't matter

- Imbalance of storytelling
	- Way too much show-not-tell
	- Entire book feels like it was a checklist

- Entire thing feels like a dangling sentence

- Too much imagery

- Metaphors that you're not entirely sure of
	- Feels like trying to solve a crime

# other

The gangster we are all looking for was a frustrating read.
Many elements of traditional storytelling were either missing or poorly done.

# examples

- Ending that goes back to the first summer
- Spends way too much time talking about Mel's keys
- When her parents are arguing and she goes into the bathroom
- Grandfather moving like a bird

# corwin's advice

- open with witty comment or question, tie into thesis
- end intro paragraph with thesis or transition
- have a few paragraphs citing random quotes and spewing out reasoning to support thesis
- restate thesis and end with clever comment again
