## response

1. Mr. Button forced Benjamin to play with the rattle and many other children's toys. Ben was told to have only warm milk until Mr. Button finally gave in and let him have toast and oatmeal.

2. Ben took lots of naps during kindergarten because he found the activities boring which lead to him being kicked out.

3. When Ben tried to enroll in Yale, he was chased out of the college because people wouldn't believe he was eighteen. He swore that he'd go to Harvard and make them regret it.

4. Ben started work at his father's hardware business and eventually ended up taking his place.

5. Hildegarde was seemingly attracted to Ben's "age" which was supposed to represent maturity.

6. Hildegarde begins to age, both in body and in mind. Ben is doing the opposite and he wants more action socially and starts finding her unattractive. Eventually, Ben's reverse aging starts to annoy Hildegarde, for some reason. She seems to either be envious or annoyed that he's not getting older properly? Ben starts to enjoy the parties and dancing with younger women and it drives a wedge between the two of them.

7. Ben finally goes to college at Harvard, like he said. He looked a little older than 18 at the time.

8. When Ben's grandson got old enough and Ben got young enough, they basically are lumped together as peers or "play-dates" as they call em at that age.
