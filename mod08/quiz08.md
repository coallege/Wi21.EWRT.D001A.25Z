### response

I would like to apply for one of the several open positions in the Michelin Structure R&D department that was advertised in today's paper. I graduated from Sandbert High School and am currently majoring in chemical engineering and minoring in botany at The Hooper College at Boulder. My experiences in molecular structure analysis combined with the several self study projects on tree sap have enabled me to produce superior analysis on rubber tree strand output that is revolutionary in the industry. Given that the rubber tree is a largely unexploited and resource, I believe I can pursue further research with assistance from your R&D department in creating tires with a more structurally sound build. The research lab that I co-ran with Dr. Carr Tyler (PhD) with six to seven other participating under graduates would make me a great team lead at your R&D department. I would be delighted for the opportunity to meet with you to discuss what I can bring to the table. Thank you.
