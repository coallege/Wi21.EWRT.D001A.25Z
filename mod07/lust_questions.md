# lust questions

1. **FIRST RESPONSE.** What do you think of the narrator? Why? Do you agree with the definition the story offers for *lust*?

The narrator seems like a certain type of person to be sleeping around. I mean, regardless of if you're a boy or girl, I guess I just label those people as "players" in my mind. There's not a whole lot to think about the narrator other than the fact that the people she's around seem to fool around a bit much.

I'm not sure I could or couldn't agree with the definition of lust. I don't really think about this subject a whole lot. It could be right, it could not be. I'm pretty sure everyone experiences, or doesn't experience, lust in different ways.

2. How effective is the narrator's description of teenage sex? What do you think she means when she says "You know just what you're doing and don't see the things that start to get in the way" (para. 29)?

Given that I will never experience teenage sex, there's no way for me to evaluate how accurate her description is. I assume that quote is talking about the actual sensation of lust itself.

3. Discuss the story's tone. Is it what you expected from the title?

I'm not sure I was expecting anything from the title. I was maybe hoping for something like lust over power instead of, well, actual lust. The story's tone actually reminds me quite a lot of Le's tone from "The Gangster We Are All Looking For". Sure, there's more dialog, but similarly, you finish reading and have to question just what, if anything, you got out of reading the passage. Are you supposed to reflect upon the role that lust plays in your life? Like in Le's memoir thing, the sections of the book seem to be divided pretty clearly by each boy she fools around with.

4. What do you think is the theme of "Lust"? Does its style carry its theme?

The word "lust" was always more of a regal word reserved for the deepest of feelings. In a way, I feel like this book and the shallow depth of emotions conveyed is nearly insulting to the title itself. Perhaps a more suitable title, such as "Teenage Sex", could've been chosen instead.

Indeed, the style of weird, no-flow writing matches its vaguely questionable theme. I would say that the writing itself matches the last paragraph, the contents of which I shall not quote here.

5. What is the primary setting for the story? What does it reveal about the nature of the narrator's economic and social class?

It seems to be at the narrator's religious private school. It sounds like she grew up a rich girl.

6. In a *Publishers Weekly* interview (November 6, 1992), Minot observed, "There's more fictional material in unhappiness and disappointment and frustration than there is in happiness. Who was it said, 'Happiness is like a blank page'?" What do you think of this observation?

I think it just displays what makes an interesting story. Some sort of conflict or struggle makes things more interesting. Not only is it more true-to-life, but it's much easier to empathize with those who are suffering than those who are not. Perhaps this skew of unhappy to happy is just representative of human nature as a whole. To maybe expand the quote “Happiness is like a blank page on which you can paint scenes of unhappiness, disappointment, frustration, and general human misery.”
