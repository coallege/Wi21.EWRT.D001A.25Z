Analyze Ariel Levy's argument in "Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture." What is she driving at? What is her purpose in writing the article? What do you wonder about? What do you question? What do you agree with? Why? Be as forthright as possible in your response, and feel free to respectfully disagree with each other in the discussion section.

It's a somewhat odd article because I feel like it's not all too inflammatory given the subject but I feel like I should either have a strong opinion one way or the other. In this case, I don't seem to have an opinion so here's a boring response to add to the discussion forum. Levy's point in the article was there was an incorrect societal assumption or understanding of what it means to empower women. Namely that allowing women to be raunchy was not the same as giving women actual power. I think the purpose was just to expose that this wasn't "real feminism", a point in which I agree with. But I also think that the United States in general is way too touchy about sex as a subject because of it's evangelical roots. I must say that I'm not too familiar with this whole period of time or the issues surrounding it and since I'm kinda touchy about sex as a subject, I doubt I'll ever be. But at least from the article, I would agree that at that time, it wasn't "post feminist", it was really just "post freedom of sexual expression", I suppose.
